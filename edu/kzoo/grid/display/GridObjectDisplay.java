/**
 *  Grid Display Package:<br>
 *
 *  The <code>GridObjectDisplay</code> interface contains the
 *  method needed to display an object in a grid.
 *  Objects that implement the <code>GridObjectDisplay</code>
 *  interface are called on by the <code>GridDisplay</code> to
 *  draw grid objects. The association between a 
 *  particular <code>GridObject</code> subclass and its display
 *  is handled in the <code>DisplayMap</code> class.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  The <code>GridObjectDisplay</code> class is based on the
 *  College Board's <code>LocatableDisplay</code> class,
